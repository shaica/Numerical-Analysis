**Prerequisite**

MAT1072 - Mathematics 1

**Course Objective**

Contributing the ability of doing mathematical operations and executing algorithms required in industrial engineering.

**Course Content**

Various problems in industrial engineering and solution techniques are discussed. The content is prepared to increase mathematical level of students to apply the solution techniques How to solve problems with unknown analytical function or equation by using discrete mathematics Algorithm concept, recursive algorithms.

**Required Reading**

- **Textbook:** Richard L. Burden and J. Douglas Faires, Numerical Analysis, 8th Edition. Student Edition: ISBN-10: 0-534-39200-8
- **Textbook:** Numerical Methods for Engineers, 5th Edition, Steven C. Chapra, Raymond P. Canale

**Expectations**

- %70 Attendance is required.
- At the end of specified lectures (Week 4, Week 7 and Week 13) quiz assignments will be given. There will be no make-up for quizzes. The lowest grade will be dropped. The remaining two grades will be averaged and accounted for second midterm grade.
- It is recommended that you do not miss any examination. A make-up will only be offered to those with a medical report. The make-up exam will be scheduled by deparment (generally in the last week of the semester) and will cover the entire course material.
