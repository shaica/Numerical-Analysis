    "This lecture on roots of equations deals with methods *that exploit the fact that a function typically changes sign in the vicinity of a root*. These techniques are called bracketing methods because *two initial guesses for the root are re-quired*. As the name implies, these guesses must “bracket,” or be on either side of, the root. The particu-lar methods described herein employ different strategies to *systematically reduce the width of the bracket* and, hence, home in on the correct answer."
