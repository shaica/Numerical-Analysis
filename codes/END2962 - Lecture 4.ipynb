    "Bracketing methods are said to be __convergent__ because they move closer to the truth as the computation progresses.

    "In contrast, the open methods are based on formulas that _require only a single starting value of x or two starting values_ that do not necessarily bracket the root. As such, they sometimes diverge from the true root as the computation progresses. However, when the open methods converge, they usually do so _much more quickly_ than the bracketing methods.\n",

In contrast, for the open method depicted in Fig.1(b) and Fig.1(c), a formula is used to project from $x_i$ to $x_{i+1}$ in an iterative fashion. Thus, the method can either (b) diverge or (c) converge rapidly, depending on the value of the initial guess."
